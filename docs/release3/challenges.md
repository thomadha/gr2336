# Challenges for the group

## 1. The testing in ui failing for some group members, even though it worked for the person merging

_Description:_ 

The testing in the ui module failed for 3 members of the group, but not for the person doing the last merging. 

_Strategy to solve the issue:_

This was discovered after the deadline when other members also tried to run the project. We decided to contact our TA to ask for advice since we didnt want to push new commits to the repo after the deadline. The TA advised us to write this as a challenge we had in release 3. 

_Reflection:_ 

It was reckless of us as a group to do so many finishing changes this close to the deadline. We have now learned that the merging and checking of the project should be done by multiple people on different computers to ensure that it runs properly for everyone. 

## 2. Sickness 

_Description:_

Throughout the semester, our group faced a significant challenge as multiple group members fell ill. This was especially prevalant in the crucial final weeks leading up to the deadline. The unexpected issue certainly added an extra layer of complexity to our academic workload, making it much harder to complete all necessary tasks. 

_The effects of this situation:_

The health challenges within our group led to an extremely stressful workload the final days before submission, causing an immense pressure towards the deadline. Despite our strategic efforts, the intensity of the situation resulted in some tasks being left unfinished. This experience emphasized the need for proactive planning, and highlighted the importance of resilience in facing unforeseen challenges.

Due to the prevalence of illness, certain members also had to shoulder a disproportionate workload, working significantly more than others in the group to compensate. This was also a big challenge, as the project became too big for the members that were able to work.
