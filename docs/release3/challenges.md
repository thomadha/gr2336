2. Sickness 

_Description:_

Throughout the semester, our group faced a significant challenge as multiple group members fell ill. This was especially prevalant in the crucial final weeks leading up to the deadline. The unexpected issue certainly added an extra layer of complexity to our academic workload, making it much harder to complete all necessary tasks. 

_The effects of this situation:_

The health challenges within our group led to an extremely stressful workload the final days before submission, causing an immense pressure towards the deadline. Despite our strategic efforts, the intensity of the situation resulted in some tasks being left unfinished. This experience emphasized the need for proactive planning, and highlighted the importance of resilience in facing unforeseen challenges.

Due to the prevalence of illness, certain members also had to shoulder a disproportionate workload, working significantly more than others in the group to compensate. This was also a big challenge, as the project became too big for the members that were able to work.
